  <p class="para3">Welcome to Haiti!</p>Have you ever considered traveling to an island in the carribean? There are many popular ones that are well known vaction spots; for example, Puerto Rico and Jamacia. However, Haiti is also a beautiful place that is worth visiting. Haiti on the world map has mostly mousintains and sea. The media tends to push the nless appealing images, but when t becomes safe to do so, I highly reccomend that people would consider visiting one day. <br> <br> Haiti is located in North America. According to Pick Visa, Haiti is the third-largest country in the Caribbean, followed by Cuba and the Dominican Republic. DR and Haiti share the same island, so if you wanted to visited the Domican republic as well, you'd be killing two birds with one stone!
    <br>  Here are my top 5 sights to see in Haiti if you ever decide to visit.
